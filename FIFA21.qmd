## Introduction

I am practicing taking FIFA 21 data and cleaning it.

```{r include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data <- fifa21_raw_data
```

## Cleaning

Checkout the `Team & Contract` column and separate by how long they have their contract period and their club. Then, find which players have played at a club for more than 10 years:

```{r}
teamtime <- data %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate('contract' = str_sub(`Team & Contract`, start = -13)) %>% 
  mutate('team' = str_sub(`Team & Contract`, start = 1, end = -15))
#[0-9]. = everything else but a digit
a <- as.numeric(str_sub(teamtime$contract, start = -4, end = -3))
b <- as.numeric(str_sub(teamtime$contract, start = 3, end = 4))
decades <- teamtime %>% 
  as.numeric(str_detect(Name, 
                        as.numeric(a)-as.numeric(b) >= 10))
```

Which players are highly valuable but still underpaid (on low wages)? (hint: scatter plot between wage and value?)

```{r}


```
