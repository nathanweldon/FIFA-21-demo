## Introduction

I am practicing taking FIFA 21 data and cleaning it.

```{r include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
data <- fifa21_raw_data

#Cleaning up team and time period played

teamtime <- data %>% 
  mutate('contract' = str_sub(`Team & Contract`, start = -13)) %>% 
  mutate('team' = str_sub(`Team & Contract`, start = 1, end = -15)) %>% 
  select(78,79)
```
